# Breakout
A recreation of the classic game of Breakout, made in MIPS assembly language

Using the knowledge of low-level programming and computer architecture gained in class, @kevinle623 and I worked together to design
and implement this fully functioning Breakout in the Mars IDE. To play the game, configure and connect the Bitmap display settings to the ones included
in the comments and connect the keyboard input tool as well. 

Commands:
b -  launch ball
a & d - move top paddle left and right
j & l - move bottom paddle left and right
q - quit
p - pause

Have fun with the rest! You get three lives in the game :)
